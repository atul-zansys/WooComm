 meet the expanding needs of Surface Mount Coaxial Interconnect Systems
 as well as the Conventional Connector Styles for Flexible and semi-rigid
 cables. Ideal for those applications which use surface mount techniques
 and smaller packaging. For example, PCMCIA Cards for Wireless LAN
 (WLAN) and Wireless Point-of-Sale (POS), Cellular Phone base stations
 and Global Positioning Systems (GPS).",,http://ppeci.com/images/uploads/products/MMC-2191.jpg,,,,,Microwave RF,PCB Mount Connectors,"['http://ppeci.com/images/uploads/products/MMC-2191.jpg', '']"
